# cheese

As Chairman of the CWRUnix Subcommittee of Nix Users for the Development of
Cheese (CWRUnix SNUDC), I am proud to annouce the creation of the command line utility
*swiss-cheese*. Upon completion of the program, it will take standard in, then
simulate throwing a slice of swiss cheese on the text. It will then print the
modified text to standard out.
